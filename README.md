# The Last Reservoir
The Last Reservoir is a first-person, narrative-driven game set in a dystopian world, drawing players into a captivating experience of ethical dilemmas and societal divides. Inspired by old sci-fi aesthetics, it challenges players to navigate a society on the brink, making choices that explore themes of resource scarcity and inequality. Our vision is to offer a gameplay experience that not only entertains but also provokes thought and reflection on contemporary issues, delivering a unique perspective on the impact of technology and power dynamics in a speculative future.

The game is set in a time of technological advancement and environmental degradation, where steam power is the pinnacle of innovation but comes at the cost of the world's most precious resource: water. The player embodies Sam; an undercover rebel disguised as a technician, who’s determined to challenge the status quo of Vapour City's impact on divided society. Guided initially by instructions through an earpiece from a fellow rebel, the player must navigate and sabotage a facility crucial to delivering power to Vapour City and uncover its ruthless ways of doing so.

We offer an immersive narrative experience that intertwines gameplay with
thought-provoking themes, presenting a unique speculative universe as a backdrop to
explore real-world issues. Bringing this game to life, we wish to contribute to a meaningful conversation on the future we envision and the paths we choose, encouraging players to consider their impact on the world and the ethical dimensions of their choices.
